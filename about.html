    <h3>Why Z.E.R.O. ?</h3>
		<p style="font-size:130%;">In 2007, a small group of musicians met in one of the most unlikely places on earth: war-torn Afghanistan. While working together, they began playing music in their off-time, and so began a band...</p>
		<p style="font-size:130%;">After they returned to the United States, they began playing in clubs, but they wanted to do more for their community. With their varied experiences in far-flung places around the world where no emergency services existed, the band wanted to ensure that the people who loved their music were also able to help local emergency responsders during emergencies.</p>
		<p style="font-size:130%;">And so, renaming themselves Zombie Emergency Response Organization, the band dedidcated their time and energy toward making sure their fans were prepared - <strong>Zombie Prepared!</strong></p>

      <h3 class="text-left">Steve Kirsch</h3>
      <h4 class="text-left">Lead Vocals and Guitar</h4>
      <p>Steven Kirsch is an American musician and singer-songwriter who is the front man for the rock band ZERO. His music is one of the foundations of the heavy metal genre.[1] He is known for his appearance (including his friendly mutton chops), his distinctive gravelly, "raspy" singing voice, which "is one of the most recognisable voices in rock", and his way of singing, looking up towards "...a towering microphone tilted down into his weather-beaten face". He is also known for his unmistakable guitar playing style, in which he used his B.C. Rich Warlock guitar to create an "overpowered, distorted rhythmic rumble". Another unique aspect of Steve's guitar sound is that he often played power chords using growling overdriven Marshall tube guitar stacks. Alongside his music career, he also had many minor roles and cameo appearances in film and television.</p>
	  <p>As a Special Forces Weapons Sergeant from 2006 to 2016, Steve employed U.S. and foreign small arms, light and heavy crew served weapons, anti-aircraft and anti-armor weapons. Controls emplacement and supervised employment during tactical offensive and defensive combat operations; During his time in Afghanistan and Iraq, he coordinated organic and supporting fire power, performed standard and non-standard air delivery of supplies to remote outstations, airborne operations to tactically insert operational elements, and directed air-to-ground combat operations.</p>
      <p>Steve was born in New Jersey, and later moved to Charlotte, North Carolina. He is influenced by rock and roll and the early works of Iron Maiden, which led to him playing in several rock groups in the 1990s. He worked as a roadie for Bruce Springsteen, before joining the death rock band Death's Icy Embrace in 2001, singing lead vocals on their hit "Eat Your Face". After being fired from Death's Icy Embrace for an assault arrest in 2005, he founded ZERO during the same year as the lead singer, guitarist, songwriter and frontman. ZERO's recent success includes the hit single "Axe Grinder" and the top charting live album No Sleep 'til Apocalypse. Steve continues to record and tour regularly with ZERO from his home in Virginia Beach, where he had lived since 2017. Aside from his musical activities, Steve is well known for his hard-living lifestyle, chain smoking, and regular consumption of alcohol (notably Jack Daniel's Tennessee whiskey).</p>

      <h3 class="text-right">Scott Falconer</h3>
	  <h4 class="text-right">Vocals and Guitar</h4>
      <p>Scott Falconer was born and raised in Nashville, Tennesee. He began playing guitar at the age of seven, inspired by his older brother Jimmie. He dropped out of high school in 1991 and joined the Army the following year, where he initially served as a cavalry scout. He also played gigs with numerous bands, earning a spot in Marc Benno's band the Nightcrawlers and later with Denny Freeman in the Cobras, with whom he continued to work through late 1997. He then formed his own band Infantry Invasion, but he renamed them Double Trouble after hiring drummer Dave Brewer and bassist Mitch Zander. He gained fame after his performance at the Montreux Jazz Festival in 2015, and his debut studio album with ZERO has been a commercially successful release that sold over half a million copies.</p>
      <p>As a Special Forces Engineer Sergeant, Scott employed both conventional and unconventional warfare tactics and techniques in combat engineering and developed spcialized engineer equipment for detecting and "deactivating" improvised explosive devices.  He also spent much of his time building the capabilities of the AfghanBorder Police's Explosive Ordinance Disposal squads. He was instrumental in organizeing, training, adviseing, and superviseing both indigenous and allied personnel on employing their perwsonnel and equipment in defensive operations. Notably, he also helped design a solar-powered guitar amplifier, which he and Matt built from spare parts.</p>
      <p>Falconer has received several music awards during his lifetime. In 2013, readers of Guitar Player voted him Best New Talent. In 2014, the Metal Foundation named him Entertainer of the Year and Heavy Metal Instrumentalist of the Year, and in 2017, Performance Magazine honored him with Hard Rock Act of the Year. Rolling Stone recently ranked him as the 27th greatest guitarist of all time.</p>

    <div class="col-sm-6">
      <h3 class="text-left">Matt Hutchinson</h3>
	  <h4 class="text-left">Vocals and Guitar</h4>
      <p>Hutchinson was born in Bremerton, Washington, where he spent his formative years, during the time of the grunge music explosion in the early 1990s. He graduated from Olympic High School in 2004. He also cites Jack Kerouac as a major influence. He studied engineering at the University of Washington in Seattle. Although he was raised Roman Catholic, he refers to himself as "this indoctrinated Catholic even though I haven't been to church of my own volition in 10 or 15 years now." He gave up alcohol in 2008 and began running marathons and ultra-marathons. He ran his first trail ultra-marathon (a running race longer than 26.2 miles) in 2013 and since then has completed several each year.</p>

     <p>Hutchinson is an agnostic, lapsed Catholic: "I don't want to falsely believe in something solely so I can jump to the front of the line for whatever this awesome place is we go after we die. The vastness of that idea is so beyond my comprehension that I feel like if there was a God, then that God would accept me saying I'm not able to believe because it's so outside of my ability to understand it. I understand that's where faith comes into play. Do I believe in zombies? Wait, what's that behind you?!"</p>

     <p>Hutchinson is an activist for gun rights and wrote 
"Human beings only have two ways to deal with one another: reason and force. If you want me to do something for you, you have a choice of either convincing me via argument, or force me to do your bidding under threat of force.
When I carry a gun, you cannot deal with me by force. You have to use reason and try to persuade me, because I have a way to negate your threat or employment of force. The gun is the only personal weapon that puts a 100-pound woman on equal footing with a 220-pound mugger, a 75-year old retiree on equal footing with a 19-year old gang banger, and a single guy on equal footing with a carload of drunken guys with baseball bats. The gun removes the disparity in physical strength, size, or numbers between a potential attacker and a defender.
People who argue for the banning of arms ask for automatic rule by the young, the strong, and the many, and that’s the exact opposite of a civilized society. A mugger, even an armed one, can only make a successful living in a society where the state has granted him a force monopoly.
Without guns involved, confrontations are won by the physically superior party inflicting overwhelming injury on the loser. When I carry a gun, I don’t do so because I am looking for a fight, but because I’m looking to be left alone. The gun at my side means that I cannot be forced, only persuaded. I don’t carry it because I’m afraid, but because it enables me to be unafraid. It doesn’t limit the actions of those who would interact with me through reason, only the actions of those who would do so by force. It removes force from the equation.
And that’s why carrying a gun is a civilized act."</p>

      <p>Matt's work as a Special Forces Communications Sergeant included the installation, utilization and operation of radio equipment, radio nets, standard and expedient antenna systems and wire communications. He managed  FM, AM, VHF, UHF, and SHF radio communication systems to transmit and receive radio messages in voice, continuous wave (CW), and burst code radio nets during critical operations in eastern Afghanistan.</p>

      <h3 class="text-right">Mitch Zander</h3>
	  <h4 class="text-right">Bass</h4>
      <p>Mitch Zander was born in Calcutta, India to American diplomat parents. He spent his formative years in various countries including India, Malaysia, Ethiopia, and Uganda before moving to Denver, Colorado to complete high school. He enlisted in the Army immediately follow the September 11 attack on the United states, and was one of the first men selected for Special Forces training without prior military service. He served only one enlistment from 2002 to 2008, and has been pursuing his musical career exclusively since leaving the Army.</p>
		
	  <p>Mitch's training as a Special Forces Medical Sergeant put him in the forefront of engaging with local emergency services in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Jordan. He operated small clinics in both Nangahar and Kandahar provinces in Afghanistan, and served as a trainer for Iraqi and Jordanian special operations medics, specializing in high-angle rescue operations and helicopter-mobile evacuation and treatment. He is also a nationally registered Paramedic.</p>

      <p>Zander briefly appeared as the bassist for such bands as What Is This?, Fear, and Jane's Addiction. He has performed with rock supergroups Atoms for Peace, Antemasque, Pigface, and Rocket Juice & the Moon, and collaborated with Mars Volta, Tom Waits, Alanis Morissette, and Young MC. Zander also performed live with Godsmack in 2013 playing the trumpet. Zander incorporates elements of funk (including slap bass), psychedelic, punk, and hard rock. In 2017, Rolling Stone readers ranked Zander the second best bassist of all time, behind only John Entwistle.</p>
		
	  <p>Based on his experiences around the world, Mitch spends much of his time conducting First Aid, CPR, and First responder training with local police and firedepartments. He is currently working to start a foundation to teach first aid to school children in South Carolina.</p>

	  <h4 class="text-left">Percussion</h4>
	  <h4 class="text-left"> MORE COWBELL!</h4>
      <p>Born in New Orleans, Louisiana, Dave Brewer is one of the founding members of ZERO. He and Scott Falconer had been playing together in their spare time for about 2 years before the band actually formed around them. Dave is the proud father of three children, and he spends his spare time with his family..</p>

      <p>Dave has been playing drums for most of his life; his mother gave him his first drum set for Christmas when he was only 8. He taught himself to play by reading magazines and watching other drummers, notably Lars Ulrich, in music videos and at concerts. Because he enlisted in the Army right out of high school, he isn't well known for his stage performances, but has done extensive session work for bands such as Tenacious D, Godsmack, and Avenged Sevenfold. His distinctive vocal style backs up Steve to create the familiar ZERO sound.</p>

      <p>Dave enjoys his privacy, but is happy to interact with his fans via social media.</p>
